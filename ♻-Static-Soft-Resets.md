Soft reset for a static Pokémon, simply just spams A until the legendary battle starts, it is not useful for static Pokémon that require extra menuing (yet).

Place the player **and save**, facing a static Pokémon.

- For modes that use soft resets such as starters, the bot will track RNG to ensure a unique frame is hit after every reset, this is to prevent repeatedly generating an identical Pokémon, this will cause soft resets to take progressively longer over time
- If resets begin to take too long, it is recommended to start a new save file with a different TID to reset this delay or check out [💎 Cheats](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%92%8E-Cheats) (`random_soft_reset_rng`)
