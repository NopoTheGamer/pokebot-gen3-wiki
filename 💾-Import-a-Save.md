If you have a save from mGBA that you'd like to import and use with the bot, then you will need to import the save state.

- In mGBA, run a game and load into the save file
- **File** > **Save State File...** > **Save**
- Double click `pokebot.py` or run `python pokebot.py` in a terminal > type a profile **name** > click **Load Existing Save**
- Open the save state file you just saved
- A new bot profile will be created in the `profiles/` folder and set up all required files
