Soft reset for starter Pokémon.

- For modes that use soft resets such as starters, the bot will track RNG to ensure a unique frame is hit after every reset, this is to prevent repeatedly generating an identical Pokémon, this will cause soft resets to take progressively longer over time
- If resets begin to take too long, it is recommended to start a new save file with a different TID to reset this delay or check out [💎 Cheats](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%92%8E-Cheats)
- **Note**: Even though you set the player to face the desired PokéBall, it is still important to set the correct `starter` in the config! This option is used by the bot to track frames to ensure a unique starter is generated every time
- **Note**: For the time being, Johto starters will automatically enable the `starters` option in [💎 Cheats](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%92%8E-Cheats), the shininess of the starter is checked via memhacks as start menu navigation is WIP (in future, shininess will be checked via the party summary menu)
