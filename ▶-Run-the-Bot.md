- Place some **official** Pok√©mon .gba ROMs into the `roms/` folder
- Double click `pokebot.py` or run `python pokebot.py` in a terminal and follow the on-screen steps to create and/or select a profile

The bot ships with the default mGBA input mapping, see [`profiles/keys.yml`](#keysyml---emulator-input-mapping) to view the default mapping, or customise them to your preference.

The bot will pause once a shiny is encountered. You **must** ensure you are able to escape battle **100% of the time**, otherwise the bot will get stuck. Auto-catching and other features will be added in due time.
