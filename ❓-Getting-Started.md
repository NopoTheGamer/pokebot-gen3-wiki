To download the latest bot from GitHub, go to the top of the page > click the green **Code** button > **Download ZIP**.

Alternatively, if you'd like to be able to easily pull the latest updates without re-downloading the entire ZIP:
- Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (you don't need an account)
- Click **Clone a repository from the Internet...**
- Use repository URL `https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3.git` and choose a save location on your PC

# Requirements
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) (**64-bit**)
- **Linux** only: Install the following packages with `apt` or appropriate package manager: `sudo apt install python3-tk libmgba0.10 portaudio19-dev`
- **Note**: running the bot will **automatically** install required Python packages and download + extract [libmgba](https://github.com/hanzi/libmgba-py) - if you're using Python for any other projects, consider using a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to isolate these packages from your base environment

## Optional
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases) - recommended for full ðŸŒˆ<span style="color:#FF0000">c</span><span style="color:#FF7F00">o</span><span style="color:#FFFF00">l</span><span style="color:#00FF00">o</span><span style="color:#00FFFF">u</span><span style="color:#CF9FFF">r</span>ðŸŒˆ and  âœ¨emoji supportâœ¨ in the console output
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - recommended for syntax highlighting while editing `.yml` config files

# Run the Bot
- Place some **official** PokÃ©mon .gba ROMs into the `roms/` folder
- Double click `pokebot.py` or run `python pokebot.py` in a terminal and follow the on-screen steps to create and/or select a profile

The bot ships with the default mGBA input mapping, see [here](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%8E%AE-Emulator-Input-Mapping) for the default mapping, or customise them to your preference.

The bot will pause once a shiny is encountered. You **must** ensure you are able to escape battle **100% of the time**, otherwise the bot will get stuck. Auto-catching and other features will be added in due time.

# Tips/Tricks
- Set **TEXT SPEED** to **FAST**
- Set **BATTLE SCENE** to **OFF**
- Utilise [repel tricks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) to boost encounter rates of target PokÃ©mon
- Using modes [Spin](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%94%84-Spin) or [Bunny Hop](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%9A%B2-Bunny-Hop) and repels will become effectively infinite + steps won't be counted in Safari Zone
- Use a lead PokÃ©mon with encounter rate boosting [abilities](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Abilities_that_affect_appearance_of_wild_Pok%C3%A9mon), such as **[Illuminate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Illuminate_(Ability))**
- Use a lead PokÃ©mon with a [short cry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmtNdlIXiif1Sz20i-9mfhFdoqb1VnAOIntlr3tnPeU)
- Use a lead PokÃ©mon with a single character nickname
- Don't use a shiny lead PokÃ©mon (shiny animation takes a few frames at the start of every battle)
