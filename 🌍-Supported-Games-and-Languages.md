Variations of games, languages and revisions may have different memory offsets, there will be a table of supported/tested variations under each bot mode listed on this wiki.

- ‚úÖ Supported (tested)
- üü® Supported (not tested)
- ‚ùå Not supported

ROM hacks will likely not work, and are ‚ùå **not supported** or planned to be supported!

The ROMs in the `roms/` folder are checked and verified against a list of all known official gen3 game hashes. If you **really** want to test a ROM hack with the bot, you must add the SHA1 hash of the ROM to `modules/Roms.py`.

The SHA1 hash of a ROM can be calculated with any of the following methods:
- [ROM Hasher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1002/)
- Windows Powershell: `Get-FileHash 'rom_name.gba' -Algorithm SHA1`
- Linux: `sha1sum 'rom_name.gba'`

Please do not seek support or complain if you find that your ROM hack does not work with the bot.
