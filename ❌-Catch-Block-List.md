A list of shinies to skip catching, useful if you don't want to fill up your PC with very common shiny encounters.

- **Note**: phase stats will still be reset after encountering a shiny on the block list.
- The block list is reloaded by the bot after every shiny encounter, so you can modify this file while the bot is running!
