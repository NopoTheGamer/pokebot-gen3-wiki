# Ruby/Sapphire
(Not implemented yet) Kyogre and Groudon and Rayquaza will not respawn if fled from, so this mode will simply utilise soft-resets.

# Emerald
After fleeing from the encounter and reloading the map, Kyogre, Groudon or Rayquaza will respawn. This mode will use the runaway method as it is generally faster over the long term when compared to soft-resets due to not having to wait for a unique frame.
