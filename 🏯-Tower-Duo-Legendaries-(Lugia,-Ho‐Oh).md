This mode will hunt the [Tower duo Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_in-game_event_Pok%C3%A9mon_(FireRed_and_LeafGreen)#Lugia_and_Ho-Oh).

After fleeing from the encounter and reloading the map, Lugia and Ho-Oh will respawn. This mode will use the runaway method as it is generally faster over the long term when compared to soft-resets due to not having to wait for a unique frame.
